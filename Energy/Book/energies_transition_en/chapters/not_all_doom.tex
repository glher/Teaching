\labch{not_all_doom}

In this chapter I will go over the fact that it does not have to be all doom and gloom. A net zero is important, but as one can see, the hurdles are immense for the entire world to move toward this. So, does that mean that it is "net zero" or nothing? What does a sufficiently lower emission tally look like in the near future?

Thinking the goal is unattainable is a surefire way of giving up before even trying. In this section, we assess the impact of falling short.
