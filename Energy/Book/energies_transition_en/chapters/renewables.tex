A renewable energy is an energy source that is replenished at least as fast as it can be used. In other words, it depends on the timescale involved, and that timescale needs to be on the human, rather than geological scale. As you know, solar and wind are considered fully renewable. As long as the sun exists, and as long as Earth has an atmosphere, we will have solar radiation and wind mechanical force to potentially harvest. Water is another such resource, with evaporation and condensation (water cycle) taking care of the replenishment of our fresh water reservoirs. Biomass, also known as vegetation, is renewable, up to what can be regrown on the order of the yearly scale.

So, an interesting thing to note is that solar energy is the basis of every single renewable energy source on Earth. The wind exists because of a temperature gradient, caused by the sun irradiance. The water cycle exists because of the evaporation and rainfalls, caused by the warmth brought by the solar rays. The biomass develops by capturing the sun energy by photosynthesis. Only one renewable energy does not depend on the sun, and that is geothermal energy, but the challenges of tapping into that resource are immense. Note that (we will expand on this) current geothermal installation tap into the limited surface flux, not the actual heat reservoir.

Fossil energies are also replenished over time, but on a timescale that are disqualifying for renewable resources. Nuclear energy is also not a renewable energy due to the finite amount of uranium or thorium notably. However, those resources are vast, which leads some to consider it as a honorary renewable energy due to its capacity at generating a lot of power with little carbon emissions. This is however not technically accurate. Some also equate nuclear fuel with fossil fuels due to the fuel mining necessary. This is also false.

Renewable energies are not all equal, both in terms of their capture or their efficiency, as well as localized variability. As a quick illustration, hydroelectric power is a renewable energy because of the water cycle replenishing the reservoir. However, at the same time, its capture and transformation to electricity is limited in terms of scale due to a limited number of siting locations available in the world. The resource itself (water) is thus renewable, but the means of capture is not.

Understandably, renewable energies have been touted as the savior for humanity for as long as we have known that fossil fuels were a problem, which is, as we have noted previously, much longer than people tend to realize. The main reason for this is two-fold. They seem to be getting back to a natural order of things, a less industrialized period, and the theoretical potential is incredible and dwarf (for solar notably) any other energy source. In a little under two hours, enough solar energy strikes the Earth to power our world society for a year.

It is consequently tempting to think that it is a simple matter of capturing it. But that capture is everything but simple.

Today, if you were to think about it quickly, or ask almost anyone in the streets, the question “What is renewable energy?”, the first two responses by far would be “solar” and “wind”. In reality, those account for a tiny fraction of the renewable energy mix, which is dominated by hydroelectricity and by the biomass. Right now, you should not really picture a solar panel or a wind turbine, but a dam or a forest, especially historically.

\section{Biomass}

Biomass energy is limited by the deforestation rate. In other words, in order for the biomass energy to be considered renewable, one must not deplete the forests at a higher rate than photosynthesis replenish them.

\section{Solar}

Direct heating from sun irradiance through windows is a big natural use. Having houses that are able to do that is important, but retrofitting is not really an option. Solar heating of air or water can also be a use of solar energy, notably for showers or house flooring. Finally, the electrical conversion through photovoltaic panels can be done.
