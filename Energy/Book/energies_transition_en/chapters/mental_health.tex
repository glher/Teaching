\chapter{Mental Health -- Coping with the situation}

In this chapter I mention who we can blame (nobody really), what one can do, what carbon accounting is and how to reasonably use it to better the world.

Fossil fuels replacement is absolutely daunting. Writing off options is the worst thing one can do, it takes a village, and weâ€™ve been on the clock for a while already. But investments need to be made coherently from a unified front.

\begin{itemize}
\item Meditate
\item Vote, with your voice and your wallet
\item Do not go into the fight with a blindfold and one hand behind your back. Nuclear is important.
\item Renewable energies are also important, due to their deployment speed, but do not aim for 100\% renewable, as storage is not a scalable savior and we will get stuck
\item Change your habits, be ready to not be able to watch Netflix at 1am or accept that your electricity may go out at any time.
\end{itemize}
