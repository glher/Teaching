\labch{energy_storage}

In this chapter I discuss several energy storage technologies.

\begin{itemize}
\item Batteries (various kind)
\item Pumped Storage
\item Compressed Air
\item Hydrogen
\end{itemize}

Here, we discuss the importance and characteristics of energy storage, round trip efficiency, what that means, and where and what is installed in the world today (vast majority pumped storage).
