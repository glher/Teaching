\chapter{Energy History}
\labch{energy_history}

In this chapter I go over human history with energies, and how energy is a limiting factor. We also go over a 100\% renewable world, the past.


By taking high resolution satellite imagery of the Earth at Night, and combining this with high resolution population data, we can estimate the regions of the world in energy poverty. \vreffig{energy_poverty} shows where energy poverty exist.

We still have a long way to go\ldots
