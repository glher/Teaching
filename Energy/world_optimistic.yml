# This is the storage capacity expressed as a percent of the installed capacity. It depends on the
# fact that 80% of the production is performed by ~60% of the time (and thus, 20% of the production during the
# remaining 40%) for wind, and by ~20% of the time (and thus, 20% of the production during the remaining
# 80%) for solar. Consequently, we want to account for this low-generation period with storage abilities.
# Consequently, batteries_li-ion are used to compensate for the 20% low-generation share.
