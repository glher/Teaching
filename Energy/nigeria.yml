# Maximum production at any given time over a year. That is, 70% of wind onshore capacity being activated at the same

# This is not considered in the storage need, as we assume that we would find localized ways of dealing with surplus
# by hydrogen creation, etc. This is nonetheless dangerous for the grid, as it means a very large load it may not be
# ready for.

# This is the storage capacity expressed as a percent of the installed capacity. It depends on the
# fact that 80% of the production is performed by ~60% of the time (and thus, 20% of the production during the
# remaining 40%) for wind, and by ~20% of the time (and thus, 20% of the production during the remaining
# 80%) for solar. Consequently, we want to account for this low-generation period with storage abilities.
# Consequently, batteries are used to compensate for the 20% low-generation share.
