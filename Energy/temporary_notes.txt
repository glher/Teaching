Compute the necessary installed capacity to meet demand over the year according to the capacity factor

This means that every last drop is needed over the year, if you lose some, you don't meet your energy needs

Storage comes down to how much can you use right away
    --> Wind and solar production graphs show that 80% of production happens in 40% and 20% of the time.
    --> So, for wind, you need to store 60% and for solar, you need to store around 80%
    --> That's assuming that things don't match, and that demand is mostly constant. If it's always windy when you need energy, and not windy when you don't, that's much better.
    Extremes:
    --> If you can use 100% of your energy because demand and production are in sync, you don't need storage and meet your need
    --> If you have solar and need your energy only at night, you need to have 100% storage backups
    Actual data: https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=46117
    --> While demand goes down at night, it's not that huge, we can use the 80% most productive hour as a good proxy
    
    --> 7 days of no wind ---> one of the extreme
    --> 7 days of no sun ---> one of the extreme
    ----> Nothing unreasonable if a technology on its own

Storage is needed for dispatch, but with losses this means you need to increase your installed capacity (overbuild) to compensate
    --> According to the scenario picked above, decide how much storage you want



Energy use:

Primary energy includes heat conversion. The IEA gives estimates of the total final consumption. In an all electric world, this is what matters. From that, let's try and see what cannot be transitioned for now. The data is from 2017 (https://www.connaissancedesenergies.org/sites/default/files/pdf-actualites/Key_World_Energy_Statistics_2019.pdf).

Coal: 1070 MTOE
--> 30% iron and steel
--> 10% petrochemical
--> 20% non-metallic minerals
--> 5% non-energy use
--> Rest (35%) could transition

Oil: 3985 MTOE
--> 16% non energy (lubricants etc)
--> 8% industrial (plastics etc)
--> Rest (75%) could transition

Gas: 1502 MTOE
--> 12% non energy
--> Rest (85%) could transition

So, we could transition:
0.35 * 1070 + 0.75 * 3985 + 0.85 * 1502 = 4640 out of 6557 MTOE, or 70%

In 2017, fossil fuels accounted for 6557 MTOE out of 9717 MTOE, or around 70%













The world today uses ~160,000 TWh of equivalent primary energy.

It breaks down, roughly:

Oil: 55,000 TWh
Natural Gas: 40,000 TWh
Coal: 45,000 TWh
Nuclear: 7,000 TWh
Hydro: 10,000 TWh
Renewable: 8,000 TWh

We want to assess the needs in a 100% electrified world. This means that we can get rid of the heat efficiency issue for fossil fuels notably and replace with a more efficient electricity use.

Let's replace our fossil fuels with electricity. This is possible for roughly two third of the fossil fuels, or around 100,000 TWh.

Transportation
--------------

This represents around a third of the fossil fuel use.

The efficiency of a modern gasoline car is around 30%. The efficiency of an EV is around 75%. So, in order to replace all the gasoline used in transportation, we need to replace ~50,000 TWh of fossil fuel (oil).

So we have: 50000 * 0.3 = 15000 TWh. This is the amount of energy needed from electricity if our EVs were 100% efficient at converting electricity to power. They're 75% efficient, so we have a need for 15000 / 0.75 = 20000 TWh.

Consequently, if the entire transportation sector were to go EV, the energy requirements would drop from 50,000 TWh to 20,000 TWh, or by 60%.

Electricity
-----------

This represent around another third of the fossil fuels uses.

For the power plants part, we can assume a relatively similar heat rate (higher efficiency than gasoline car, but also higher efficiency of production system than batteries trips). Here we want to transition ~50,000 TWh again. So we get, using a 40% efficiency conversion factor, that we drop our energy requirements from 50,000 TWh to 20,000 TWh again, a 60% drop.


Direct
------

For direct heating, no change in energy consumption, and renewables will have trouble making a dent in that sector, mostly industrial processes requiring very high temperatures. Biomass/waste could be used, but would encounter a renewability issue quickly.




So, from this very quick estimate, we conclude that maximazing the electrification of the energy grid would mean that we go from ~160,000 TWh to ~100,000 TWh, or a 35-40% drop.
